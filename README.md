### 🚀 What I Do

I design and build scalable, real world software with a strong focus on **performance, reliability, and problem solving**.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **mobile, data, and intelligent systems**, where impact actually matters.

> There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don’t.

I approach problems analytically, break complexity into systems, and obsess over edge cases.  
Competitive environments motivate me. Hard problems keep me sharp.

### 🔭 Current Focus

- Breaking deep into **Data Science**
- Leveling up in **competitive programming and algorithms**
- Shipping projects that solve real user problems

### 🤝 Let’s Connect

If you are building something ambitious, challenging, or technically demanding, I am always open to a conversation.
